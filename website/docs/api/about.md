# About

`@callstack/repack` API documentation can be found here: [`@callstack/repack` API](./repack/index).
You should use this link if you're using Re.Pack in your project to build React Native applications.

Additionally Re.Pack provides API documentation for these packages as well:

- [`@callstack/repack-dev-server`](./dev-server/index) - Documentation for bundler-agnostic development server. Unless, you're trying to integrate a bundler other than Webpack, this API will not be useful to you.
